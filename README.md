**A comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing credit card transactions and customer data to uncover performance insights and trends.**

---

## 🧾 Overview

This project focuses on designing an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** that provides actionable insights into credit card usage, customer demographics, and financial performance. By cleaning and transforming raw data, key metrics were visualized to support data-driven decisions for stakeholders.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Financial institutions often handle large volumes of credit card transaction data and customer profiles. Without proper tools and visualization, identifying trends, inefficiencies, or opportunities becomes difficult. This project aims to bridge that gap by:

- Cleaning and structuring unorganized datasets
- Modeling relationships between customer behavior and transactions
- Creating a real-time weekly dashboard to support strategic decisions

## 📂 Datasets

The analysis is based on **two unstructured CSV files**:

1. `credit_card.csv` – Contains transaction-level data
2. `customer.csv` – Contains customer profile and demographic data

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
